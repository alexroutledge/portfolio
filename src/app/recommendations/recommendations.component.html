<h2>Ben Morrison - Client Services Manager at RichRelevance</h2>
<p>"Alex is one of the most hard-working individuals that I've ever had the pleasure to work with. Often the first person in the office and last one out, he is driven by customer satisfaction and a pride in his craft. He is a highly regarded developer within the department and always happy to shoulder additional responsibility. He is technically strong and has even taken on the role of security expert for the web development requirements of PCI. I would recommend Alex highly."</p>
